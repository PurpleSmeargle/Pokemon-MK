**What is this?**

The goal of this project is to write an open-source engine (and a kit on top of that) for 2D Pokémon. It is aimed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux. This engine uses MKXP, an open-source implementation of RGSS which allows you to configure even things that would normally be locked away behind RPG Maker XP. MKXP does not depend on RPG Maker XP and is thus completely free.

**What does this engine offer?**

As this is a brand new engine, we can add things useful for creating Pokémon-style games, such as shortcuts for events (think about giving Pokémon, giving items, controlling money, etc.
We can do everything how we want it ourselves, and take suggestions from other people.

As for features, here is a list:
• Our framework uses RGSS 3, which is a lot faster and better optimised than RGSS 1 and RGSS 2. This allows the game to run at a solid 60 frames per second.
• Our framework uses Ruby 2.1.0, which is a huge improvement over RPG Maker XP’s Ruby 1.8. More features, more support, faster, etc.
• The game will be playable cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
• We have full control over the engine behind it; we can change things as we please.
• Infinite map layers
• Infinite priority (z) values
• Infinite terrain tags
• Events can define their own priority value
• Maps made in RPG Maker XP can be imported and converted to maps usable with this engine.
• More control over maps, as you can set properties such as passability, terrain tags, and priority values per tile per layer. They do not depend on a tileset, which means you can make your map perfect when it comes to these values.
• Extensive documentation on classes, methods, and scenes, as well as documentation for eventers.
• Scripts can be stored in three ways which you can pick from; RPG Maker XP’s rxdata, plain .rb files, or a custom compacted script file.
• Script Editor of your choice; you can use the basic, built-in script editor or choose a different program to edit your scripts with.

**Why would I use this over RPG Maker XP + Pokémon Essentials?**

First off, the event engine is completely customised for Pokémon games. Some event options include:

(General tab)
• Display Text
• Display Sprite
• Manipulate Sprite
• Move
• Set Switch
• Set Variable
• Set Local Variable
• Condition
• Run Code
• Change this event
• Erase this event
• Break out of event
• Other ideas we have as development goes on

(Player tab):
• Give Pokémon
• Manipulate Pokémon
• Give Item
• Manipulate Money
• Battle Wild Pokémon
• Battle Trainer
• Other ideas we have as development goes on
