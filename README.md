**What is this?**

The goal of this project is to write an open-source engine (and a kit on top of that) for 2D Pokémon. It is aimed to be cross-platform, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux. This engine uses MKXP, an open-source implementation of RGSS which allows you to configure even things that would normally be locked away behind RPG Maker XP. MKXP does not depend on RPG Maker XP and is thus completely free.

We’ve chosen the name “**Pokémon MK**”.
